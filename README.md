# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I need to put more comments in but it's hard when you're behind, I wanted to try some intermediate goals that felt doable but just can't manage to finish them, it'll be a future thing to work on. For now, the messages go in, the likes work, it looks good - pleased. It's not easy being behind but I'm trying to get things done instead of getting in panic-mode! ':)
